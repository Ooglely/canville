## How it works
canville is connected directly to the Canvas API (only for UMSystem), allowing you to earn coins automatically by completing assignments on Canvas. The more assignments you do, and the better you do on them, the more coins you get. The coins you earn allow you to purchase decorative items for your personal town. The index page provides a map with all of the towns on the website, with it updating live as players create and update towns.

## Notes
